  <p style="margin: 10%; margin-top: 5%; position: relative;">After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite,
    elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles. 2 All the royal officials at
    the king’s gate knelt down and paid honor to Haman, for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai
    would not kneel down or pay him honor.

    3 Then the royal officials at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s command?” 4 Day after
    day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai’s
    behavior would be tolerated, for he had told them he was a Jew.

    5 When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged. 6 Yet having learned who
    Mordecai’s people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all
    Mordecai’s people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes.

    7 In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, the pur (that is, the lot) was cast in
    the presence of Haman to select a day and month. And the lot fell on[a] the twelfth month, the month of Adar.</p>
