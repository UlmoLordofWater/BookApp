  <p style="margin: 10%; margin-top: 5%; position: relative;">1 This is what happened during the time of Xerxes,[a] the Xerxes who ruled over 127 provinces stretching from India
    to Cush[b]: 2 At that time King Xerxes reigned from his royal throne in the citadel of Susa, 3 and in the third year
    of his reign he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. The military leaders of Persia and Media, the
    princes, and the nobles of the provinces were present.
    
    4 For a full 180 days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and glory of his majesty. 5 When
    these days were over, the king gave a banquet, lasting seven days, in the enclosed garden of the king’s palace, for
    all the people from the least to the greatest who were in the citadel of Susa. 6 The garden had hangings of white
    and blue linen, fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were
    couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other costly stones. 7 Wine
    was served in goblets of gold, each one different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant, in keeping with
    the king’s liberality. 8 By the king’s command each guest was allowed to drink with no restrictions, for the king
    instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished.
    
    9 Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.</p>
